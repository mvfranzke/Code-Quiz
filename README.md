# Module-4-Challenge (Code Quiz)
## Description
This is the fourth assignment or challenge for our bootcamp class. In this assignment we have to create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice. The user must be able to complete the quiz within a given time, for every incorrect answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from their total time. Once user finish answering the available question or if their time have run out, they will then be able to save their score with their name or initial for tracking purposes.

In this assignment we were able to apply what we've learned about Web API's from the past week such as using window object, DOM, set attributes, event listener, time intervals, append and how to use local storage.
